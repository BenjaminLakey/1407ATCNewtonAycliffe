		<h3>Cadets:</h3>
		<p class="infoDesc">
			If you are aged between 12 (and in year 8) and 17 you can join at any time. Simply contact us either through email or Facebook and we will arrange a time to come down and meet us. Dont worry there is no commitment to join, we are pretty sure though when you do come down you may not want to leave!<br/><br/> 

			For the first few weeks, you will come down in civilian clothes, be introduced to the Squadron and given some basic lessons about the ATC and about drill and uniform. after this if you are still interested you can then be enrolled as a member of the Air Training Corps. <br/><br/>

			Once you have been enrolled you will begin your cadet career and have all the opportunities like on our What we do page. What are you waiting for? <br/><br/>

			Your uniform is fully provided all you have to buy is parade shoes. <br/><br/>

			Subscriptions at time of update are Â£14 per month, which can either be paid by standing order (preferred) or Cash/Cheque. <br/><br/>

		<h3>Adults</h3>
		<p class="infoDesc">
			Over 20? Have some spare time on your hands? <br/>
			If so you could look at joining us as a member of staff. You dont need any experience or training, just a willingness to try new things and a can do attitude. we teach you the rest. <br/><br/>

			All our volunteers are DBS checked and regularly trained in Safeguarding and Child Protection.<br/><br/>

			We have a number of options to volunteer: <br/><br/>

			Civilian Committee: This is the backbone of any squadron. The committee look after all the finances, cadet welfare & fundraising for the squadron. Generally meeting up a few times a year and on certain events, the committee make sure we can provide the best training to our cadets. <br/><br/>

			Civilian Instructor (CI): A CI is a civilian volunteer who does not wear uniform but still provides our cadets with either specialist or general training. There is no time commitment which means people with busy lives still find time to help out where they can. <br/><br/>

			Uniformed Officer/NCO: In a role as either a commissioned officer or a Non Commissioned Officer you will take a lead in the running and management of a squadron. As well as this you will lead your cadets by setting the example and being the RAF's "Blue Footprint" when out in the public view. Being a Commissioned officer or an NCO is a personal choice as both roles are very different, but both come with full training so dont worry about being put in the deep end! <br/><br/>

			Regardless of which role you decide to go down, all staff receive mandatory ongoing Child protection and Safeguarding training as well as ongoing continuous professional development. Courses and qualifications are open to all Civilian instructors and uniformed members of staff. <br/><br/>
